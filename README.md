## Disclaimer
**This project is intended for educational and ethical cybersecurity research only.** Any use of this software on systems, services, or individuals without **explicit permission** is strictly prohibited and may be illegal. It is the end user's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and platform policies. The authors assume no liability for any misuse or consequences.

## What Does It Do?

This project demonstrates how Discord bots can be used to **simulate social engineering techniques**, such as impersonating account verification flows for platforms like Minecraft. It is designed to help developers, educators, and security professionals understand and visualize how deceptive user interfaces might trick users into sharing account information.

The bot can be configured to request a Minecraft username and email under the guise of "verification." It then simulates a login prompt through Microsoftâ€™s authentication interface, showing how attackers might attempt to exploit trust and trick users into sharing login codes.

This simulation can be used in **closed environments** for security awareness training or ethical testing. **No real account credentials should be collected or misused.**
